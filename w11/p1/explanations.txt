a)
    If the namespace std is commented out,
    there are many errors for the declaration and the use of strings
        error: ‘string’ was not declared in this scope;
        error: ‘endl’ was not declared in this scope;
    The errors occur because the string class is definded in the namespace std.
    Without including the namespace or a prefix the class cannot be used.
    To fix that everytime the keyword "string" is used write "std::string" 
    instead.

    The same errors apply for the "cin" and "cout" and "endl" keywords
        error: ‘cin’ was not declared in this scope;
        error: ‘cout’ was not declared in this scope
        error: ‘endl’ was not declared in this scope;
    the streams are not defined w/o the namespace so a "std::" has to be 
    prepended.

b)
    If the "Critter:: is removed for the methods the programm does not know
    that the function is performed in the class. It will try to perform 
    the function like a regular function.
        error: ‘name’ was not declared in this scope;
    The programm cannot know what data is stored in the Critter and the variable
    will not be definded in the function.
    This could be fixed by creating the methods in the header file 
    within the class.
