a)
    There are many errors for the declaration and the use of strings
    The string class is not definded w/o the namespace std
    To fix that everytime the keyword "string" is used write "std::string" 
    instead.

    The same errors apply for the "cin" and "cout" and "endl" keywords
    the streams are not defined w/o the namespace so a "std::" has to be 
    prepended
